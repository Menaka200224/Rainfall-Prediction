#Rainfall Prediction

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to forecast rainfall using historical weather features such as temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and pressure.

## ðŸ“Œ Features Used
- Average Temperature
- Humidity
- Cloud Cover
- Atmospheric Pressure

## ðŸ”§ Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation & Feature Importance
4. Model Training & Evaluation

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- `avg_temperature` shows a strong positive correlation with rainfall.
- `humidity` also have a strong positive correlation with rainfall.
- Feature importance techniques guide the model in identifying influential predictors.
- Multiple machine learning models are compared to optimize accuracy.
